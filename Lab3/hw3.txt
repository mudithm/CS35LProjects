Q1.  The patch improves the performance of ls in terms of speed; it replaces an
     if statement with an assignment statement.

Q2.  If any other code used by the company was designed with the previous
     behavior of ls -aA (or any other such permutation) in mind, it might behave
     incorrectly. For example, if something expects ls -aA to include . and ..,
     or if it expects that the ignore_mode variable will only change if it is
     the default, it might have its own workaround, which would be made obsolete
     or incorrect by the patch.

Q3.  If the script is invoked with an empty file, it raises an IndexError. This
     is because the chooseLine() function makes use of random.py's choice
     function, which raises this error if it is passed an empty sequence as its
     input.

Q4.  If you run the script with Python3, it results in a syntax error on line
     65, where the line
     	 except IOError as (errno, strerror):
     is present. This syntax works with Python 2.x because of something called
     "automatic tuple unpacking." Python 2 is able to iterate through the two
     arguments to errno by this process. Python 3 removed this functionality,
     and so iIn Python 3, this is invalid syntax; instead, the errno and
     strerror errors should be examined individually.
