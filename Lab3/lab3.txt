The problem does still appear when running ls -aA or ls -a -A.

Using ls --version, we find that the installed version is:
ls (GNU coreutils) 8.24


1. To get the coreutils-8.29 tarball, we use
      wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
   And we untar and unzip it with
      tar -xJvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz

   To get the signature and the gnu keyring, we repeat the wget command, with
      wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
      wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg

   To verify its signature, we use the given command
      gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig

   This outputs the following:

   gpg: Signature made Wed 27 Dec 2017 10:29:05 Am PST using RSA key ID 306037D9
   gpg: Good signature from "Padraig Brady <P@draigBrady.com>"
   gpg:      	       	aka "Padraig Brady <pbrady@redhat.com>"
   gpg:			aka "Padraig Brady <picelbeat@gnu.org>"
   gpg: WARNING! This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
   gpg: 	 There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
   Primary key fingerprint: ...................

   The key is no longer certified with a trusted signature. This may be because
   the key is expired, or that the owner did not choose to go through a trusted
   authority to certify their signature. It could also mean that the linux
   servers do not have the key in gpg.

2. To install Coreutils in our own directory, we do the following:
      mkdir ~/coreutilsInstall
   Then we switch into our unzipped coreutils directory from before
      cd coreutils-8.29

   Reading the "INSTALL" file tells us to run ./configure, make, and make
   install.  We then run the configure and installation scripts, with an
   absolute installation path specified

   ./configure--prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/mudith/coreutilsInstall
   make && make install

   At first, I didn't specify an absolute path and recieved an error specifying
   that the path must be absolute. After changing that, it worked fine.
      
3. We then change into the coreutilsInstall directory with
      cd ~/coreutilsInstall

   Running the bin/ls -aA and bin/ls -a -A commands results in the same
   incorrect behavior, showing . and .. at the beginning of ls.

4. To apply the patch to the coreutils install, we first download the patch
      cd ~/Documents/CS35L/Lab3/coreutils-8.29
      curl 'https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi ..... long path ...;msg=10' > patch.diff

      We can see from the patch (cat patch.diff) that the files that are being
      replaced are all in a directory "a." But in our installation, the files
      are in the directory "coreutils-8.29" (the current directory).  So, we run
      the patch command with the -p1 option to ensure that the "a" portion is
      removed.

      Then, we run the patch.

      patch -p1 < patch.diff

5. Running make in the coreutils-8.29 folder:

   The c file ls.c was modified and had to be recompiled.
   The other changes were made to files that were not in the build structure
   for ls.

6. Using ~/Documents/CS35L/Lab3/coreutils-8.29/src/ls -aA and
   	 ~/Documents/CS35L/Lab3/coreutils-8.29/src/ls -Aa and
   	 ~/Documents/CS35L/Lab3/coreutils-8.29/src/ls -a -A and
   	 ~/Documents/CS35L/Lab3/coreutils-8.29/src/ls -A -a
   all produce the desired results (when the A flag is later, the . and .. are
   not shown, and when the a flag is later, the . and .. are both shown). The
   later option now overrides the earlier.
      
   Running the tests in /tests/ls/a-option.sh requires the following:
   In coreutils-8.29:
   make check TESTS=tests/ls/a-option.sh
   resulted in a PASS for tests/ls/a-option.sh.


   To make sure that the behavior of the original install is still incorrect, we
   use ~/coreutilsInstall/bin/ls -aA and ~/coreutilsInstall/bin/ls -Aa.

   Both commands contain . and .. , meaning they perform incorrectly.
