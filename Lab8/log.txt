Startup:

First, I ssh-d into the beaglebone and checked that I had openssh-client and
openssh-server installed

    dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh
    


Server Side:
-----------
 
Then, I generated a public/private rsa key pair at the deault location using
ssh-keygen, with the password "beaglebone" At first, I tried using the password
"ball," but this was too short.

	ssh-keygen
	beaglebone
 
Then, I created a new user, "ansh",  and set his password to "ilove35l"

	sudo useradd -d /home/ansh -m ansh
	sudo passwd ansh
	ilove35l

I then created a .ssh directory for ansh,
	cd /home/ansh
	sudo mkdir .ssh

Then, I changed the ownership and permissions so that these directories were
owned by the ansh user

	sudo chown -R ansh .ssh
	sudo chmod 700 .ssh

This sets it so that the owner, ansh, has read, write, and execute permissions,
and that the group and other users have no permissions.

My partner performed the same steps on his machine, except with the username and
directory "mud"


Client Side:
------------

For the client side, I created new public/private RSA keys using the password
"bonebeagle"
	
	ssh-keygen
	bonebeagle

using the location "/root/.ssh/id_rsa2"

I then connected to a hotspot from my phone. I found my IP address next to wlan
in the output of ifconfig

	ifconfig

	Result: 192.168.43.133

and gave it to my partner.


My partner gave me his IP, 192.168.43.187, and I used this to send him my public
key.

	ssh-copy-id -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa2 mud@192.168.43.187

This successfully added the key to the server.

I then tried to add id_rsa2 to the agent
	
	ssh-add /root/.ssh/id_rsa2

but I received the error "Could not open a connection to your authentication
agent" Some research showed that this might be because the ssh-agent was not yet
running, so I ran the command

	exec ssh-agent bash

and then tried adding id_rsa2 again, this time successfully.

	ssh-add /root/.ssh/id_rsa2
	bonebeagle

I then ssh'd into the server with the server and entered the password.

	ssh mud@192.168.43.187
	ilove35l

To test the connection, I created a file called file and added the text "This is
a file" to the file.

	touch file
	echo "This is a file" > file

This happened successfully.

I exited this connection and then ssh'd again using the -X flag, and then ran
firefox

	ssh -X mud@192.168.43.187
	firefox

and then I disconnected and reconnected with -Y

	ssh -Y mud@192.168.43.187
	firefox

Running firefox with the -Y flag seemed to be quicker; the launchtime was faster
and the browser was more responsive. However, both methods were really slow, and
firefox was not very usable either way.
