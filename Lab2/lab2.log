To get website:   curl web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall18/cs35L/assign/assign2.html > assign2.html

Tests of commands:

      cat assign2.html | tr -c 'A-za-z' '[\n*]'

      	  Kept the strings containing only A-Z and a-z input the same, replacing all other symbols with newlines

      cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-za-z' '[\n*]'

      	  Did the same as above but removed all whitespace

      cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-za-z' '[\n*]' | sort

      	  Sorted the output of the previous in ASCII order

      cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u

      	  Did the same as the previous, but listed each string only once
	  
      cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm - words

      	  Outputted a three column list in which the first column represents strings contained only within the
	  assign2 file, the second only in the words file, and the third in both files.

	  also used man comm to find this

      cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm -23 - words

      	  outputs the same as the previous command, but with the second and third columns suppressed.
	  So, only the strings that appear solely in the first file.
