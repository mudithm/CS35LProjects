1. Created this file using emacs hw9.txt

2. Checked out of the fresh repository from the Lab, diffutils-3.0.
   	git checkout v3.0 -b quote

3. Installed the patch using:
   	patch -p1 < ../quote-3.0-patch.txt

   This modified 6 files.

4. Looked up the add-change-log-enty-other-window function for emacs.

5. Generated a ChangeLog entry for each file using C-x 4 a in each modified file
   	emacs src/cmp.c
	C-x 4 a
   And added the description
        quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this',
	except in comments
   next to each file.

6. Added the files and committed changes to the branch using
   	git add src/*.c
   	git commit -F ChangeLog

7. I then generated a patch file using
        git format-patch --stdout -1 > ../formatted-patch.txt

   The -1 flag indicates that I only want to format a patch for this commit, not
   for the entire commit history leading up to this commit.

8. I sent the patch to my partner and received his in return.
   To test his patch, I checked out v3.0 again, this time to the branch partner
        git checkout v3.0 -b partner
	git am < formatted-patch-partner.txt
   I ran make check again, but because I was not on Server 5, it failed.
   I used the diff . - and the diff --help commands, and the output was correct.

9. I used make distdir and checked that the resulting ChangeLog file had my
   partner's changes on top.
	make distdir
	cat diffutils-3.0.1-100c/ChangeLog


10. I ran gitk on the server, while sshed using the X option, and the window
    appeared on my desktop.
    	ssh -X mudith@lnxsrv.seas.ucla.edu
	cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
	gitk
