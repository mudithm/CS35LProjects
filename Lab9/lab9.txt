1. First, I got the diffutils repostitory using the command
       git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/diffutils.git

2. Then, I used the git log command in the diffutils directory and piped its
   output into a file
   	git log > git-log.txt

3. I used the git tag command in the same directory and piped its output into a
   file
	git tag > git-tags.txt

4. I then search the git-log.txt file for the given commit:
      cat git-log.txt | grep -B 5 "maint: quote 'like this'"
   and see that the commit hash is 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f

   I create a patch for this commit using the command
      git show 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f > quote-patch.txt

5. I check out Version 3.0 from the repository using the command
      git checkout v3.0 -b version3_branch

6. I use the patch command to apply the patch to version 3.0.
      patch -p1 < quote-patch.txt

7. I run git status
      git status
   and see many modified files and untracked new files.

8. Looked up what vc-diff and vc-revert do
   In the *vc-diff* buffer, checked the functions we could use
   
9. All the files that were modified are listed in the output of git status.
   The modified files listed in the result of
       git status | grep -vF ".c"
   were:

    modified:   NEWS
    modified:   README
    modified:   TODO
    modified:   doc/diagmeet.note
    modified:   ms/config.bat
    modified:   ms/config.site
    modified:   po/en.po
    modified:   src/diff.h
    modified:   src/system.h
    modified:   tests/help-version

   I opened each of these files with emacs and reverted the changes using
   vc-revert

	C-x v u
	yes

   The command
     git status | grep -F ".c"
   indicated the following c files were modified:

    modified:   src/analyze.c
    modified:   src/cmp.c
    modified:   src/context.c
    modified:   src/diff.c
    modified:   src/diff3.c
    modified:   src/dir.c
    modified:   src/ifdef.c
    modified:   src/io.c
    modified:   src/sdiff.c
    modified:   src/side.c
    modified:   src/util.c
											   

   So, I opened all of them in emacs.

       	emacs src/<file>.c

    For each file, I used C-x v-= to open up the buffer, and then C-u C-c C-a
    and on the hunks that were not merely changes to character string constants.

    Running git status now only shows 6 modified c files.

10. The rejected patches were in the sections for option arguments in the diff.c
    and diff3.c files. It was fairly straightforward to find the matching line
    in the diff c file and replace it with the corrected line from the .rej
    file.

11. I removed all the untracked file using git clean -f.

12. Git status still reported about a half dozen modified files, but now nothing
    else.

    I put the git diff into a file using
      git diff > ../quote-3.0-patch.txt

    This patch file was 326 lines long.

13. I built the new Diffutils using the commands listed in the README-hacking
    file.

    ./bootstrap
    ./configure
    ./make
    ./make check

    This last step resulted in some errors, but running the commands
    	./src/diff . -
	./src/diff --help
    both resulted in the desired output.

14. I first renamed the modified diffutils src code to "diffutils-3.0-patch"
    using the mv command. I then recloned the diffutils repo and checked out
    version 3.0 as before, and renamed its src code to "diffutils-3.0".

    I ran the command

      diffutils-3.0-patch/src/diff -pru diffutils-3.0   / 
      diffutils-3.0-patch > quote-3.0-test.txt
      	
15. I then ran the diff command on quote-3.0-test.txt and
    quote-3.0-patch.txt. The output of this diff shows that the patch was
    successful.
